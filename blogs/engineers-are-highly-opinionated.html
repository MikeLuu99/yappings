                    Why do you think we C++ or Rust was borned? No, let think
                    about why do we go from punched card to Assembly to C to C++
                    to Rust? It's probably some or many guys feel that the
                    current approach is inefficent and inadequate. Yeah, they're
                    probably opinionated.

                    New web frameworks are introduced every month. There're like
                    hundred of different cloud database providers even though we
                    just have SQL DB with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL and
                    NoSQL. For slightly large-scaled technical problems, we have
                    dozen of different approaches to solve them. For slightly
                    large-scaled technical problems, we have dozen of different
                    approaches to tackle them. These all come down to software
                    engineers and architects believe in their own unique and
                    'optimize' approach. It is also hard to measure whether a
                    approach is better or not since most of the time the end
                    results is basically identical. Whether you use Next.JS or
                    Astro, though they have some innated differences in
                    performance, your customers will probably never know that
                    they are using a highly optimized Astro's island
                    architecture with built-in react compiler (those are the
                    main topics I found on daily.dev and I have no idea what I'm
                    talking about).

                    Since it's kinda hard to know weight different software
                    approaches against each other, they just keep existing
                    unless some drastic performace different or breaking bugs
                    occur. For that reason, software engineer can keep being
                    opinionated about their tech stacks and frameworks since
                    having a concrete answer to a software debate is futile. I
                    mean even artist don't have that much opinions about their
                    favorite art eras and styles.
