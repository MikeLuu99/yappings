                <h2>What is a generalist?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think everyone is familar with terms like "generalist",
                    "polyglot", or "jack of all trades". In my opinion, they
                    probably all mean the same thing. A person who is good at
                    multiple thing. Oh, but that does not sound clear at all.
                    What are things? and when can you say that a person is good
                    or not. If you define 'things' as in skills, how specific
                    are you talking about? Can I be a generalist by knowing a
                    dozen of different of programming languages. However, I can
                    also be a generalist if I know how play the piano, paint,
                    programming, speak a second language, play sports and great
                    at cooking too. In the first case, am I a generalist by
                    having skills in multiple programming languages or am I
                    specialist since I am highly knowledgeable in the single
                    topic of programming?
                </p>
                <h2>Generalist vs Specialist</h2>
                <p>
                    My answer is that you're probably both. My definition of
                    specialist and generalist is usually inclusive of both. At
                    first glance, a person who know a lot of programming
                    languages seem like a generalist but when you look deeper,
                    you realize they've actually specialized in something quite
                    specific: the meta-skill of learning programming languages.
                    They understand the underlying patterns, the common
                    paradigms, and how to transfer knowledge between syntaxes.
                    That's not generalism—that's specialization in linguistic
                    adaptation within the programming domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take another example: someone who speaks five languages
                    fluently. Are they a language generalist? At surface level,
                    sure. But dig deeper and you'll find they've become
                    specialists in language acquisition itself. They've mastered
                    the patterns of grammar structures, developed strategies for
                    vocabulary retention, and honed their ear for phonetic
                    nuances. They're not just collecting languages; they're
                    specializing in the art of linguistic convergence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same logic applies to that person who plays piano,
                    paints, programs, speaks multiple languages, excels at
                    sports, and cooks amazingly. What looks like scattered
                    expertise is actually deep specialization in cross-domain
                    pattern recognition. They've become specialists in
                    identifying the fundamental principles that govern skill
                    acquisition across different fields. They see the connection
                    between muscle memory in piano and sports, between the
                    logical structures in programming and cooking recipes,
                    between the creative flow in painting and language learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why I believe the generalist-specialist distinction
                    is often a false dichotomy. Every apparent generalist is
                    actually a specialist in disguise—specialized in synthesis,
                    in meta-learning, in finding the common threads that weave
                    through seemingly unrelated domains. They've developed what
                    you might call "transferable expertise", the ability to
                    rapidly extract principles from one area and apply them to
                    another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when someone asks whether they're a generalist or
                    specialist, maybe the better question is: what are you
                    really specialized in? Because chances are, underneath that
                    broad knowledge base lies a very specific and valuable
                    expertise in connecting dots that others can't even see.
