                    Recently, I was recommeded a youtube video names
                    <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWhg5siacBg&ab_channel=DIEONN"
                        >How to Make Cool Sh*T That People Fu*k With.</a
                    >
                    I stayed throughout this video because of the editing and
                    videography, which were pretty cool with fast-paced b-roll.
                    However, the most important thing I extract from the video
                    is.

                        connection"

                    As a maker and artist at heart who wants to make "Cool shit"
                    that other people fuck with, this encapsulates most of the
                    experiences as a musician and a programmer. While making
                    something that wins over people, you need something that
                    they resonates with. By the term "resonate", it means a
                    thing that moves them, a thing that touch into the
                    subconscious area of the mind. There, perfection hardly
                    exists. Why? because perfection is what our conscious mind
                    prefer and want. For example, when you go to a restaurant,
                    you would prefer something like a "perfect" dining
                    experiences. Your mind craves this since it is convenient
                    for you to have a perfect waiter, a perfect meal, a perfect
                    dining area with quiet customers, and maybe a perfect
                    bathroom. I believe this is why people are so obsess with
                    perfection. It just makes thing easy for them. You can link
                    it to something like a perfect painting, a perfect vacation,
                    or a perfect song. They all hit the checkboxes in your mind
                    and make it easier for you to process as well as enjoy them.
                    Perfection if basically just the comfort zone of your mind.

                    How about connection? Why do we fuck with that more? I don't
                    have a concrete answer for this but this is common when it
                    comes to the subconscious part of our mind. But honestly,
                    connection is just more fun and exciting. Instead of a
                    generic perfect vacation in Paris or someplace, how about a
                    trip to New Orleans to experiences jazz music with your dad,
                    who has been influencing you with Miles Davis' tones for 10
                    years. Connection simply touchs upon the deeper level of
                    your mind and experiences. It is more real and authentic
                    while perfection delves into the shallow and convenient part
                    of your mind in enjoying stuffs. To put in simply,
                    perfection is a one-sided thing when you only care about
                    ticking all the checkboxes requirements in your case instead
                    of caring about your audiences. On the other hand,
                    connection is a two or multi-sided concept. You may not tick
                    all the checkboxes, but you show care for other people
                    checkboxes too. What do they want? What do they enjoy? Why
                    would they enjoy it? A great example for this could be a
                    romantic relationship. Flooded on the internet, I always see
                    advises like build the "Build the best version of yourself
                    and the love will come" or some grandiose quote like "Don't
                    waste your time chasing butterflies. Mend your garden, and
                    the butterflies will come." Although I do agree that you
                    should always strive for the best version of yourself first
                    instead of chasing love, I feel like people miss the
                    connecion part in a relationship. When you're dating
                    someone, it will always be a bidirectional connection. You
                    need to embrace the other one's uniqueness and traits
                    instead of just building your own perfect image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this idea is relevant in not just relationship but
                    also any crafts in art, social skills, or maybe just finding
                    the joys in life. You should connect with a human by being a
                    human first, and perfect is definitely not a human traits.
                    Connection relates to self and others while perfection is
                    just selfish.
