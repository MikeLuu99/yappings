                    I've discussed about how mathematics as a form of art in one of past essays.
                    Now, not only can you find mathematics in beauty, you can also find it in
                    languages. Semantics, grammars, syntax, morphology, discourse, pragmatics, ...
                    These are mainly discussed in an anthropology or linguistic class. However, I
                    find semantics, syntax, and morphology to highly familiar in mathematics.
                    Semantics in mathematics can simply just the idea and visualization of discrete
                    math. Syntax in mathematics are the common operators that we see daily with =,
                    &lt;, &gt;, or even the sigma function (that I don't know how to write in markdown).
                    Finally, morphology is a core concept in different fields in mathematics like
                    linear algebra, discrete math, or even abstract algebra. "Mathmatical
                    morphology" is actually a pretty cool field about processing and analysis of
                    image, using operators and functionals based on topological and geometrical
                    concepts (yeah, i got that from wiki). Mathematic language also need to have
                    structure like languages. You can see this idea as the grammar in mathematics.
                    An equation need to have expressions on two sides with the "=" syntax in the
                    middle. An equation can be false if the two expressions are not semantically
                    return and point to the same value. Writing 1 = 1 and saying I am myself all
                    return true.

                    This can link us to the idea of logical operators with /forall, /exists, /neg,
                    /wedge, /vee. These can all be define to for all, exists at least one, not,
                    and, or. They literally have identical semantics in both mathematics and
                    languages in general. Consider A and B to be expressions or statements. By
                    using these logical operators, you are literally creating sentences/statements
                    in both mathematics and verbal languages. There're many more examples of this
                    in mathematics but this is probably the easiest representation of how plain
                    english and math can have the same semantics. However, I am not saying that any
                    sentences in english can be converted to a true and reasonable mathematics
                    statements. Sentence like "This statements is false" simply do not have a
                    finite answer in math and basically an infinite paradox. This concept can be
                    linked to Godel's incomplete theorem that you can research more on. Therefore,
                    you can represent any math with english but definitely not vice versa, showing
                    that Math's incompleteness and also english verbosity when it can describe
                    impossible statements. This also makes plain languages not rigorous. I believe
                    this is one of the reason why just plain english can not always be used for an
                    LLM to make a rigorous and provable mathematical proofs or algorithms.

                    This essay is on one of the topic that I hardly have any expertise on but a
                    good way for me to explain my thoughts on mathematics as a language and the
                    weirdness of our good old english. English is really informal and proofs and
                    programs are probably the most formal things I can think of. English is just
                    not a good choice for the formal specifications of programs. That's why we need
                    programming languages and proof assistants.
