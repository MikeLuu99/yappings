                    v0, Lovable, Softgen, Base44, ... How many more of these do we need?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yeah, we just don't need them all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mean we still need them but these are all general solutions doing the same thing with similar levels of complexity. We may need more of these software solutions but can we have please have them for different use cases? Maybe one for building internal tools, one for healthcare software, one for manufacture, or maybe one for games? It would be nice to have unique and use cases specific solutions.
