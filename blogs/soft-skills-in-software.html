                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    If we have technical skills on one hand, soft skills would be on the other hand
                    in the spectrum of necessary skills in software or in any occupations in
                    general. Technical skills deal with the tool while soft skills deal with
                    people. In most of software fields, there will always exist some factors of
                    human in it. That is why I believe soft skills can be on par with the need for
                    technical skills. Specifically, soft skills can be how you deal with conflicts
                    in designing a new feature or project; it can also be how react to criticizes
                    from your engineering manager; it can even be how you write your comments so
                    the next interns can try their best to fix your buggy code. In other words,
                    whenever there's some kind of human to human interactions, you'll probably need
                    some kind of soft skills. You can understand it as the EQ (Emotional
                    Intelligence) in software engineering.

                <h2>The importance</h2>
                <p>
                    Engineer like Gergely Orosz and John Ousterhout both agreed on the idea that
                    the difficult part of software engineering actually comes from the people.
                    Conveying your code to stakeholders, product mangers, peer coders, or intern is
                    a highly difficult task to keep everyone on board with your ideas via just
                    code. You maybe a "10x" productive engineer that can produce thousands lines of
                    code in just a few days but if no one on your team can actually understand your
                    ingenious implementation of this new distributed databases, it is unlikely to
                    be a long-term meaningful product. Focus on the term "long-term", yes, your new
                    database may be valuable for decreasing the latency of the current mass
                    transactions load the product is suffering. However, you're unlikely to be
                    working on it alone for the next 10 years; someone should be able to step in
                    and improve and add new features to the code. Thus, this is a great example of
                    both technical and soft skills. You'll need to be both highly technical to
                    refactor your code into a better design so your team can understand it and you
                    should get started on writing the docs and also the necessary comments to
                    explain your code. I frequently see how developers consider technical and soft
                    skills as mutually exclusive while I think they should be highly coupled
                    together. Every technical decision should have some thoughts about the
                    liability of this code in the future and the developers that have to endured
                    them. In contrast, you should not always agree to the developer that tell you
                    that he/she is going to rewrite our build system since it is too slow justt
                    because he/she is a good person. You should consider the technical magnitude of
                    the rewrite project and its revelancy to the product in general.
                </p>

                    Resolving conflicts is also a common issues in software engineering and I am
                    not talking about git conflicts in this case. The question about to write this
                    tool from scratch or to use a software vendor; the question of to self-hosted
                    or to use cloud services; the question of PostgreSQL or MySQL. Those are the
                    constant polarizing discussions that developers may have among each others.
                    Therefore, you can not just yell at the other person and tell them that they're
                    dumb though that's the case sometime. Finding the middle ground should be the
                    priority for every party. Whenever we're deciding between two or more options,
                    I try to make a pros/cons chart with tradeoffs. This make the team see the
                    clearer image since we're not always open minded people until the facts are
                    right in front of us. Software engineering is sometimes really opinionated and
                    subjective. That is when we need something like a mathmematical proof to settle
                    the debate and contention. Just using tangible analysis of costs and tradeoffs
                    can make any engineer be reasonable.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    As software engineer, it is hard to talk to a human without start showing them
                    your terminal setup and features demo but I think we should always try to write
                    code with some future intern in mind. Ask this question, what if 5 years from
                    now, an intern read my code and submit a pull request with the title "Legacy
                    code got mogged" and he/she rewrite your code in the most elegant and simple
                    way you can think of. I would feel proud but somewhat shameful too.
