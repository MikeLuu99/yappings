                        I hardly ever wrote down journals as a kid. I always had
                        these ideas and abstractions in my head that I couldn't
                        articulate properly.

                        When I was like 8, I raised my hand to say that Math is
                        a form of art and the teacher correct me for about 5
                        different times.
